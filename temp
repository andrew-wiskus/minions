_____ + [SENDER] + Superstore = a recipe for destruction. The missing ingredient is you, [RECIPIENT].

[RECIPIENT], [SENDER] and the squad has been living rent free at the Gulag while you’ve been gone. They could use an upgrade in living spaces.

[RECIPIENT], [SENDER] says your squad is dealing with a ‘lack of leadership’ issue. Time to take control of the situation.

You have been cordially invited to squad up in #Warzone. [RECIPIENT] ➡️ 🚁. [SENDER] ➡️ 🔫.

[RECIPIENT], [SENDER] isn’t sure if helicopters have a “shotgun,” but if they do it’s yours if you squad up right now.

Congratulations, [RECIPIENT]! You’ve just won a lifetime supply of Squadding up with [SENDER]! Acceptance is required. 😁

[RECIPIENT], [SENDER] knows you’re afraid of mole people, but assures you there are none living in the new #Warzone Subway System.

Dear [RECIPIENT], it’s time. Sincerely, [SENDER].

[RECIPIENT], [SENDER] says you can’t spell “You and me should squad up in #Warzone” without “you” and “me.” We checked. It’s legit.

[RECIPIENT], [SENDER] claims you’re the best Gulag rock thrower the world has never seen. Time to take your talents public and squad up!

[RECIPIENT], you gotta ride the #Warzone subway with [SENDER] and the squad. They’re tired of being the only ones 6-feet under.

[RECIPIENT], [SENDER] has agreed to buy you back once per week if you rejoin the squad for Season Six.

[RECIPIENT], [SENDER] and the squad wants to grind through the Battle Pass with you until you all unlock Nikolai. You could be the Noisy Nikolais.

[RECIPIENT], reasons to squad up with [SENDER]: New subway, new Battle Pass, new modes, new maps.

[RECIPIENT], Season Six is the season of the squad. But [SENDER] says there’s no squad without you.

[RECIPIENT], [SENDER] wrote you a song to get you back into the squad. It’s not great, but the intentions were nice.

[RECIPIENT], [SENDER] says the winner’s circle isn’t the same without you. Probably because they haven’t been back since you left.

Picture this [RECIPIENT]: your squad is down, [SENDER] is crying, you’re the only hope. You grab a sniper, BANG, BANG, BANG, the enemy is down. You save everyone… But it won’t happen if you don’t squad up.

To: [RECIPIENT], LFG. From: [SENDER].

[RECIPIENT], [SENDER] and the squad have a secret message for you but you can’t share it with anyone: “We ❤️ u in the squad.” They said you’d know what it means.

[RECIPIENT], [SENDER] says if you rejoin the fight, you can choose how you get around #Warzone in Season Six: 🚇, 🚁, 🚂, 🚚

[RECIPIENT], your squad without you: 😭, your squad with you: 😀 and [SENDER] confirmed it.

[RECIPIENT], [SENDER] has been raving you. Says you’re the best squadmate and most naturally talented marksman ever and your squad can’t win without you.

[RECIPIENT], [SENDER] promises to take a bullet for you getting off the new #Warzone subway if you rejoin the squad.

[RECIPIENT], [SENDER] wants to shoot so many ships with you, whatever that means. But you gotta squad back up.

[RECIPIENT], [SENDER] needs you to ride the #Warzone subway with him. It’s dangerous to go alone.

[RECIPIENT], [SENDER] wants to travel #Warzone with you. Imagine all the places you’ll see and enemies you’ll destroy together thanks to the new subway!

[RECIPIENT], [SENDER] and your squad wrote a song so you’d drop back into #Warzone. Put them on mute and listen to some War Tracks instead.

[RECIPIENT], an incomplete squad is a dead squad. [SENDER] wants you back in the winner’s circle during Season Six.
